## 1. Install the SDK

bash

```
pip install tknops-llm
```

## 2. Get your API key

Grab your API key from the [tknOps Dashboard](https://app.tknops.io/settings/api-keys).

## 3. Initialize the client

python

```
from tknops_llm.client import AIAnalytics

client = AIAnalytics(api_key="your_api_key_here")
```

## 4. Track your first request

Wrap your LangChain calls in a function. When the function is called, pass the context as tags:

python

```
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize once
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

# Your service function
def generate_response(message: str, user_id: str, tags: list[str] = None):
    response = llm.invoke(message)
    
    # Track with whatever context matters to you
    client.track_response(
        response=response,
        user_id=user_id,
        response_type="langchain",
        tags=tags or []
    )
    
    return response
```

Now when your app calls this function, pass the tags that matter:

python

```
# Called from your chat feature
generate_response(
    message="Help me draft an email",
    user_id="user-123",
    tags=["chat-feature", "team-sales", "premium-tier"]
)

# Called from your agent
generate_response(
    message="Summarize this document",
    user_id="user-456",
    tags=["agent", "team-engineering", "free-tier"]
)
```

Head to your [dashboard](https://app.tknops.io) to see costs broken down by any of these tags.

### Tag by what matters to you

| Tag by        | Example                 | See in dashboard     |
| :------------ | :---------------------- | :------------------- |
| User          | `user_id="user-123"`    | Cost per customer    |
| Team          | `tags=["team-sales"]`   | Cost per team        |
| Feature       | `tags=["chat-feature"]` | Cost per feature     |
| Customer tier | `tags=["premium-tier"]` | Cost by pricing tier |
| Environment   | `environment="prod"`    | Prod vs dev spend    |

This is how you find the \$20 customer costing you \$40.
